# 👋 Hi, I’m Nabanita!

I’m a software developer who loves building meaningful technology with empathy, curiosity, and a global mindset. Whether I’m architecting backend systems or exploring ethical AI, I’m driven by the desire to make tech kinder, smarter, and more inclusive.

### What I’m into:
- Backend wizardry(or witchery!?) with Java, JS and AWS
- Exploring global cultures and sustainable tech solutions
- Machine learning (teaching computers to be as curious as I am)

### Currently:
- MS Computer Sciences at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Yes, it super chilly here trying not to freeze solid 🥶!
- Worked at Salesforce and Qualcomm. (Yes, I’m collecting Big Tech experiences like Pokémon).
- Interned at Americxan Express
- Documenting my journey through tech, life, and learning
