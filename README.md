# Greetings planet!

Namaste peeps! In this era of Instagram, I am glad that you stumbled upon my Github profile.

I am Nabanita Bag, a passionate tech enthusiast from India. After graduating from NIT Allahabad in 2020, I am currently enabling Wireless connectivity through Bluetooth as a Software engineer in Qualcomm, Hyderabad. During my internship at American Express, Bangalore I explored NoSql databases and Java.

Being born in Kolkata and brought up in across India, I have been raised to be an inquisitive person. This has brought me to the world of programming.
I love exploring and keeping updated about technologies and worldviews. Having tried my hands on applications of Machine Learning and Android a bit, I am now exploring creating cool products using my full stack Web Development skills.

Go on and explore my profile! 

Feel free to reach out to me on nabanita5041@gmail.com
