# Namaste, I’m Nabanita!

I’m a software developer who loves building meaningful technology with empathy, curiosity, and a global mindset. Whether I’m architecting backend systems or exploring ethical AI, I’m driven by the desire to make tech kinder, smarter, and more inclusive.

### What I’m into:
- **Backend wizardry** (or witchery!?) with Java, Python and AWS
- Exploring global cultures and sustainable tech solutions
- **Machine learning** (teaching computers to be as curious as I am)

### Currently:
- MS Computer Sciences at **University of Wisconsin-Madison**. Trying not to freeze solid 🥶!
- Worked at **Salesforce** and **Qualcomm**. (I’m collecting Big Tech experiences like Pokémon).
- Interned at American Express, Bangalore (Yeah, some finance shenanigan there!)
- Documenting my journey through tech, life, and learning

### Fun Facts:
